# StableDiff-ControlNet
This project is an implementation of ControlNet based on the paper "Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543). It builds on core Stable Diffusion components such as DDPM and unconditional/conditional diffusion, then adds ControlNet conditioning and related experiments (DiT, a simple video generator, and a brief DDIM walkthrough).
